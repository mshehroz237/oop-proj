# oop-proj

In this application first i created basic tests for employee, enginner, intern and manager in those i am testing if objects gets created or not and names ids, school and office number, In employee class i created a constructor and made 4 functions which return data. In enginner class i extend employee class, made gteRole and get githib functions.Intern also extends employee class gave it school and getRole functions. Manager class also extends employee class gave it get Role amnd get officeNumber fucntions. In index.js ceated a an empty array which contains all the objects being created based on the user prompts. Then using fs.writeFile to make the new html file. In templaye.js created a fucntion that will run diffrernt fucntions that will in return make cards. Created a for loop to check if the fucntions gets called or not based on the role, and then at bottom creating the html file.
